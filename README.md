# Notes-for-projects.
Stuff to do that isn't in GitHub's project pages.

https://github.com/Sarah-C/AtomMatrixSCroll-WIP
Continue to add M5Stack Atom Matrix functionality:
1. Add scrolling features like speed, "ping-pong" forward/backward. Pause at location (via an unused ASCII char followed by time?).
2. 24bit user defined characters.
3. Animation for a character.

4. Expand to ANY Neo-Pixel board.......
* A: Implement multi height fonts.
* B: Enable scroller to be placed at specific Y co-ord for tall matrices.
* C. Ensure "serpentine" display mode works.
